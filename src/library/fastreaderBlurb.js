const fastreaderBlurb = `FastReader is an experiment in a new way of reading, taking advantage of the unique way in which screens allow us to deliver text, without
the need to turn pages or even scan a line of text. Instead, FastReader delivers a single word at a time, allowing you to adjust the speed according to your own
comfort. This allows for rapid intake of a text at rates in excess of 600 words per minute. As the app develops we will add more features according to user feedback
and continue to explore news ways to read.`
